## Branching and Workflow

When you are assigned a new task or want to create a new feature, always create a new branch. Here's the complete workflow:

### 1. Create a new branch

Make sure you are on the main branch before creating a new branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <task-number-feature-name>
```

### 2. Work on the new branch

Now you're ready to start coding! After making your changes, stage and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```

### 3. Push your branch to GitHub

Once you've committed your changes, push your branch:

```bash
git push origin <feature-branch-name>
```

### 4. Open a Pull Request

Go to the GitHub repository page. Open a Pull Request from your feature branch into main. Wait for approval and any necessary code reviews.

### 5. Merge the Pull Request

Once the PR is approved, merge your changes into the main branch through GitHub.

### 6. Clean up branches

After merging, you can delete the feature branch both locally and on GitHub:

Checkout on your local main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

**Locally:**
```bash
git branch -d <feature-branch-name>
```

**On GitHub:**
```bash
git push origin --delete <feature-branch-name>
```

### 7. Pulling all the recent changes

Ensuring everything works fine, you should pull all the recent changes from the main repository BEFORE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN:

```bash
git pull
```
